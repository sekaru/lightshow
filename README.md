# Lightshow
Create custom light shows with your LIFX bulbs.

# Setup
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html - use the React Native CLI section.

# Issues
I may or may not come back to this project but there are a few outstanding issues to consider when using the app:
- Need to use something more precise for timings - something similar to `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Need to stop looping sequences when you navigate away from the home screen.
- Can't set custom colours for sequences.

# Built with
React Native and [node-lifx](https://github.com/MariusRumpf/node-lifx).
